## Problem Statement

### The Challenge: Adolescent menstrual health faces three critical barriers:

1. **Knowledge Gap**: Many adolescents and caregivers lack clear understanding of what constitutes normal vs. abnormal menstruation.
2. **Communication Barrier**: Stigma and embarrassment prevent open discussions about menstrual concerns between adolescents, caregivers, and healthcare providers.
3. **Delayed Care**: Without understanding normal parameters, abnormal symptoms often go unreported, leading to delayed diagnosis of underlying conditions like PCOS, endometriosis, or thyroid disorders.

### Key Statistics:
- Up to 38% of adolescent girls experience menstrual disorders
- The average delay in diagnosis for endometriosis is 7-10 years, often beginning in adolescence
- 75% of young women report receiving inadequate education about menstrual health
- Only 14% of adolescents consult healthcare providers about menstrual concerns

This problem disproportionately affects underserved communities with limited access to specialized healthcare and comprehensive sexual health education.

## Solution: Meet Dottie

Dottie is a conversational AI assistant designed as a friendly, knowledgeable "Period Bestie" for adolescents navigating menstrual health.

### Core Features:

- **Symptom Assessment**: Evaluates menstrual patterns against age-appropriate clinical guidelines.
- **Personalized Education**: Provides developmentally appropriate explanations based on user's age and knowledge level.
- **Decision Support**: Helps determine when to seek medical attention vs. when patterns are within normal range.
- **Conversation Starters**: Provides scripts to help teens discuss concerns with parents and healthcare providers.

### Unique Approach:

- **Character-Based Interface**: Dottie's friendly mascot design reduces stigma and anxiety.
- **Medically Accurate**: Built on ACOG guidelines and reviewed by adolescent gynecologists.
- **Privacy-Centered**: Age-appropriate design with strong data protection and privacy controls.
- **Accessible Language**: Uses clear, non-clinical language with optional educational deep-dives.
- **Culturally Responsive**: Content addresses diverse cultural contexts and beliefs around menstruation.

## How Dottie Works

### User Journey:

1. **Onboarding**: Brief questionnaire establishes baseline information about age, menstrual history, and concerns.
2. **Assessment**: When users report concerns or unusual symptoms, Dottie guides them through a conversational assessment using clinically-validated questions.
3. **Personalized Guidance**:
   - **Green**: Reassurance when patterns are within normal range.
   - **Red**: Clear guidance to seek healthcare when patterns suggest potential issues.
4. **Educational Content**: Contextual information about menstrual health delivered through engaging, age-appropriate explanations.
5. **Healthcare Connection**: When needed, helps prepare for healthcare visits with symptom summaries and questions to ask.

### User Experience:
The interface balances friendly engagement with medical credibility, using accessible language while maintaining scientific accuracy.

## Datasets & Knowledge Base

### Medical Foundation:
- ACOG Committee Opinion No. 651 (2015): Core guidelines on normal menstrual parameters.
- Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine clinical recommendations.

## Development

### Project Structure
- **backend**: Express.js API server with API endpoints
- **frontend**: (Coming soon) User interface for the Dottie application

### Architecture

#### Database
Dottie uses a dual-database approach to simplify development while maintaining production readiness:

- **Development**: SQLite for local development (no setup required)
- **Production**: Azure SQL Database for scalable cloud deployment
- **ORM**: Knex.js provides a unified query interface across both database types

This architecture allows developers to work locally without needing to set up a database server, while ensuring a smooth transition to production with Azure SQL.

#### Backend
- **API Server**: Express.js handles HTTP requests and routing
- **Data Models**: Knex.js models for database interaction
- **Authentication**: (Coming soon) JWT-based authentication
- **Middleware**: Express middleware for request processing

### Backend Port Configuration & macOS Compatibility

By default, the backend runs on:

- **Port 5000** on Windows/Linux
- **Port 5001** on macOS (to avoid conflict with AirPlay)

You can override this by creating a `.env` file in `/backend`:

```env
PORT=5050
```

### Getting Started

#### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies, return to root:
   ```
   cd backend; npm install; cd ..
   ```

2. Navigated to the frontend directory and build dependencies:
   ```
   cd frontend; npm install; npm run build
   ```

3. Run frontend (activates backend by itself with concurrently)
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

### Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: SQLite (dev), Azure SQL (production)
- **ORM**: Knex.js for database queries
- **Testing**: Vitest, Supertest
- **Documentation**: Docusaurus (see `/docs` directory)
