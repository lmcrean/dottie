# Testing Strategy ✅ COMPLETED

## Comprehensive Test Suite
- **Integration Tests**: API and Web service integration testing
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete user workflow testing with Playwright
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing in GitHub Actions

## Integration Tests (`integration-tests/`)

### API Integration Tests (Node.js + Vitest)
- ✅ HTTP endpoint testing with Supertest
- ✅ CORS configuration validation
- ✅ JSON response structure validation
- ✅ Error handling and status codes
- ✅ Concurrent request handling
- ✅ Database integration testing

### Web Integration Tests (React + Vitest)
- ✅ Component testing with React Testing Library
- ✅ API client integration testing
- ✅ Error state handling and UI updates
- ✅ Async operation testing
- ✅ Context and hook testing

## End-to-End Tests (`e2e/`) ✅ REORGANIZED

### Unified E2E Directory Structure

**Organization Strategy**: Centralized e2e testing with clear separation between frontend and backend tests to improve maintainability and reduce refactoring pain.

### Directory Structure
- `e2e/frontend/` - Frontend E2E tests (moved from frontend/e2e/)
- `e2e/backend/` - Backend API E2E tests (moved from backend/e2e/)

### Playwright Configurations (Split by Service)
**Local Development:**
- `playwright.frontend.local.ts` - Frontend local testing (React app + API)
- `playwright.backend.local.ts` - Backend local testing (API endpoints only)

**Branch Deployments:**
- `playwright.frontend.production.branch.ts` - Frontend branch testing (deployed React app)
- `playwright.backend.production.branch.ts` - Backend branch testing (deployed API)

**Production Deployments:**
- `playwright.frontend.production.main.ts` - Frontend production testing (stable React app)
- `playwright.backend.production.main.ts` - Backend production testing (stable API)

### Frontend E2E Tests (`e2e/frontend/`)
- **Master Integration**: Complete user workflow testing
- **Feature Runners**: Organized by functionality (assessment, auth, chat, user)
- **Test Scenarios**: Real user interactions with the React application
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Mobile devices

### Backend E2E Tests (`e2e/backend/`)
- **API Integration**: Direct API endpoint testing
- **Development Tests**: Local development validation
- **Production Tests**: Deployed API validation
- **Feature Coverage**: Authentication, assessments, chat, user management

### Key Benefits
- **Unified Structure**: All E2E tests in one location
- **Clear Separation**: Frontend vs Backend test organization  
- **Independent Testing**: Can test frontend and backend separately
- **Specialized Configurations**: Each config optimized for its specific test type
- **Reduced Refactoring**: Easier to maintain and update test configurations
- **Better Organization**: Feature-based test grouping
- **Flexible Execution**: Run frontend or backend tests independently based on changes

### Environment Variables for Production E2E Tests
- `WEB_DEPLOYMENT_URL` or `CLOUD_RUN_WEB_URL` - Web app URL (web configs only)
- `API_DEPLOYMENT_URL` or `CLOUD_RUN_URL` - API service URL (all configs)

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Complete hello world user flow
- ✅ API connectivity validation (multiple endpoints: `/`, `/health`, `/api/health`, `/api/health/status`)
- ✅ Error handling and retry mechanisms
- ✅ Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- ✅ Mobile device compatibility
- ✅ Performance and timeout handling
- ✅ CORS configuration testing
- ✅ Concurrent request handling
- ✅ Frontend-API integration validation

## Testing Commands
- **All Tests**: `npm run test:all`
- **Backend Unit Tests**: `npm run test` (from backend/ directory) - Vitest
- **Frontend Unit Tests**: `npm run test` (from frontend/ directory) - Vitest

### E2E Testing Commands (from e2e/ directory)
**Local Development:**
- `npx playwright test --config=playwright.frontend.local.ts` - Frontend local tests
- `npx playwright test --config=playwright.backend.local.ts` - Backend local tests

**Branch Deployment Testing:**
- `npx playwright test --config=playwright.frontend.production.branch.ts` - Frontend branch tests
- `npx playwright test --config=playwright.backend.production.branch.ts` - Backend branch tests

**Production Testing:**
- `npx playwright test --config=playwright.frontend.production.main.ts` - Frontend production tests
- `npx playwright test --config=playwright.backend.production.main.ts` - Backend production tests

### Legacy Commands
- **E2E Development**: `npm run test:dev` (from frontend/ directory) - Playwright headed mode
- **Custom Runner**: `node test-runner.js [api|web|e2e|integration|all]`
