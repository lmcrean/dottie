## Reasons for this Caveat

- the primary focus of this app is outreach and educational experience for software developers
- the app is a concept app, it will not be commercialised nor is it intended/liable for earnest medical use.
- considering the absence of financial or real product incentive, providing an unlicence provides opportunity for all code contributors to use this codebase as a highly valuable educational experience. Just as an example, if they solve backend encryption problems, laer in their software careers they can use the code for other projects
