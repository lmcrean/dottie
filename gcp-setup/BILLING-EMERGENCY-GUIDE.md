# GCP Billing Emergency Guide

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

Your current billing shows **£18.04** in charges, primarily from **10 Cloud Run services** running simultaneously.

### Problem Identified
- **10 Cloud Run services** active in dottie-app-37930
- Many are old branch deployments (issue-416, issue-418, claude-fix-issue-424, etc.)
- Only 2 services needed: `api-main` and `dottie-api-main`
- **8 unnecessary services** are costing you money

### Cost Breakdown (Typical)
- Cloud Run: £0.30-£1.00 per service per month (idle)
- Cloud Run: £2-£5 per service per month (with traffic)
- **Your 10 services: £15-£25/month estimated**

---

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Do This Now)

### 1. Set Up Budget Alerts (5 minutes)

Run this PowerShell script:
```powershell
.\gcp-setup\setup-billing-limits.ps1
```

This will:
- Create a £5/month budget
- Set alerts at 50%, 75%, 90%, and 100%
- Configure minimum resources for Cloud Run
- Generate a cleanup script

### 2. Configure Email Notifications (2 minutes)

**CRITICAL**: You won't receive alerts without this!

1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/alerting/notifications?project=dottie-app-37930
2. Click **"Create Channel"**
3. Select **"Email"**
4. Enter your email: `lmcrean@gmail.com`
5. Verify the email
6. Click **"Save"**

### 3. Delete Old Services (10 minutes)

Run the cleanup script:
```powershell
.\gcp-setup\cleanup-old-services.ps1
```

This will **delete 8 old services** and keep only:
- `api-main` (production)
- `dottie-api-main` (production backup)

**Expected savings: £12-£20/month**

## COST PREVENTION STRATEGIES

### 1. Automated Branch Cleanup

Update your GitHub Actions workflow to **automatically delete** Cloud Run services when PRs are closed.

Add to `.github/workflows/deploy-branch-preview.yml`:

```yaml
cleanup-on-pr-close:
  if: github.event.action == 'closed'
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: Delete Cloud Run Service
      run: |
        SERVICE_NAME="api-${{ github.head_ref }}"
        gcloud run services delete $SERVICE_NAME \
          --region=europe-west2 \
          --project=dottie-app-37930 \
          --quiet || echo "Service already deleted"
```

### 2. Set Resource Limits

Ensure all Cloud Run services use minimum resources:

```yaml
# In your deployment scripts
--min-instances=0          # Scale to zero when idle
--max-instances=1          # Limit concurrent instances
--cpu=1                    # Minimum CPU
--memory=512Mi             # Minimum memory
--concurrency=80           # Max requests per instance
--timeout=60s              # Request timeout
```

### 3. Enable Allways-Free Resources

Your project should use Cloud Run's free tier:
- **2 million requests/month FREE**
- **360,000 GB-seconds/month FREE**
- **180,000 vCPU-seconds/month FREE**

As long as you stay within these limits, you pay **£0**.
