# PR #401: Implement new GitHub Actions to Google Cloud workflow with successful deployment branching

## Overview

This PR migrates the deployment infrastructure from Vercel to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and implements comprehensive deployment branching for both production and preview environments.

## What Was Changed

### Before (Vercel-based)
- Single deployment target (Vercel)
- Limited branching strategy
- No containerized deployments
- Simplified but less scalable architecture

### After (Google Cloud-based)
- **Containerized Deployments**: Docker images built and deployed to Google Cloud Run
- **Artifact Registry**: Container image storage and management
- **Deployment Branching**: Separate workflows for production and preview deployments
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD

## Key Achievements

### 1. Production Deployment Pipeline
- **Workflow**: `deploy-api.production.main.yml`
- **Trigger**: Pushes to `main` branch
- **Target**: Cloud Run service with predictable naming (`dottie-api-main`)
- **Features**: 
  - Automated testing before deployment
  - Container image building and pushing
  - Health checks and validation
  - CORS configuration testing

### 2. Branch Preview Deployments
- **Workflow**: `deploy-api.production.branch.yml`
- **Trigger**: Pull requests and feature branches
- **Target**: Dynamic Cloud Run services (`api-{branch-name}`)
- **Features**:
  - Automatic cleanup of existing services
  - Branch-specific URLs for testing
  - Same validation as production

### 3. Service Account Security
- **Created**: `github-actions-deploy@dottie-app-37930.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- **Permissions**: Least-privilege access for deployment operations
- **Authentication**: Service account key-based (replacing Workload Identity Federation)

### 4. Comprehensive Validation
- **GCP Authentication**: Multi-step verification of credentials and project access
- **API Enablement**: Automatic enabling of required Google Cloud APIs
- **Container Registry**: Artifact Registry setup and permission testing
- **Deployment Health**: Endpoint testing and CORS validation

### 5. GitHub Actions Integration
- **Secrets Management**: Streamlined secret requirements (`GCP_SA_KEY`)
- **Removed Dependencies**: Eliminated unnecessary GitHub token validation
- **Error Handling**: Robust error detection and reporting
- **Parallel Execution**: Optimized workflow performance

## Technical Benefits

### Scalability
- Container-based architecture supports horizontal scaling
- Cloud Run's serverless model handles traffic spikes automatically
- Artifact Registry provides reliable image storage and versioning

### Development Workflow
- **Preview Deployments**: Every PR gets its own deployment URL
- **Testing**: Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
- **Validation**: Comprehensive health checks before deployment completion

### Monitoring & Debugging
- Detailed logging throughout deployment process
- Clear error messages with actionable troubleshooting
- Health endpoint validation ensures deployments are functional

## Workflow Files Added/Modified

1. **`deploy-api.production.main.yml`** - Production deployments
2. **`deploy-api.production.branch.yml`** - Preview deployments  
3. **`project-config.yml`** - Centralized configuration
4. **Load-config action** - Reusable configuration loading

## Security Improvements

- **Service Account Isolation**: Dedicated service account for deployments
- **Minimal Permissions**: Only required GCP roles assigned
- **Secret Management**: Reduced secret requirements
- **Authentication Validation**: Multi-step verification process

## Environment Support

### Production Environment
- **URL Pattern**: `https://dottie-api-main.{region}.run.app`
- **Deployment**: Automatic on main branch
- **Configuration**: Production-optimized settings

### Preview Environment  
- **URL Pattern**: `https://api-{branch-name}.{region}.run.app`
- **Deployment**: Automatic on PR creation/updates
- **Configuration**: Development-friendly settings

## Migration Impact

This change represents a significant infrastructure upgrade:
- **From**: Simple Vercel deployment
- **To**: Enterprise-grade Google Cloud deployment with full CI/CD

The new system provides better scalability, monitoring, and development workflow while maintaining the same application functionality for end users.

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Completed**: Infrastructure setup, service account creation, workflow development
üîÑ **In Progress**: Final authentication configuration updates
üîç **Next**: Address remaining service account permission validation
