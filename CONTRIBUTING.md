# How to contribute a pull request

1. Check the [Issues](https://github.com/lmcrean/dottie/issues) tab
2. submit an initial commit and convert to a `pull request`
3. convert your pull request to `draft` (illustration below)
4. reference the existing issue with the # feature e.g. `#134`.
5. **convert the PR to an open pull request when ready!**

# What to check before contributing a pull request

1. [Issues Tab](https://github.com/lmcrean/dottie/issues): check if someone commented on the issue already
2. [Pull Requests Tab](https://github.com/lmcrean/dottie/pulls): check the existing drafts

It may be worth reaching out to that peer and offering to contribute an isolated issue to their branch

# Including Screenshots

- be sure to **include screenshots and or screen recordings** of the new outcome before opening the issue.
- This will help the moderators quickly understand what progress has been made.

# How to open a new issue

if you spot an issue please open in the [Issues Tab](https://github.com/lmcrean/dottie/issues)

- please add labels! This helps newcomers in particular understand the codebase
- ensure issues are labelled `must have` or `nice to have`
