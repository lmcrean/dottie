# How to contribute a pull request

2. submit an initial commit and convert to a `pull request`.
3. convert your pull request to `draft` (illustration below)
4. reference the existing issue with the # feature e.g. `#134`.

# What to check before starting a pull request

- [Pull Requests Tab](https://github.com/lmcrean/dottie/pulls): check the existing drafts. *This is the central space for being aware of current progress.*

*It may be worth reaching out to that peer in the PR comments and offering to contribute an isolated issue to their branch.*

# What to include before completing a pull request

1. pull from `main` branch to ensure no merge conflicts between `branch` and `main`
2. run `cd frontend; npm run build` causing no typescript errors
3. include # in description e.g. #243. This links the pull request to issue(s) solved
4. add **screenshots and or screen recordings** of the new outcome

Optional: to request the code owner team to manually test the branch in their IDE, you can add the label `action required: manual testing`

template provided [here](/pull_request_template.md).
